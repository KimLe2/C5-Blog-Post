                    Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare 2 baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper. In a small bowl, mix one whole egg with 1 teaspoon of water, then set aside.<br><br>
                    In a separate medium bowl, use an electric mixer on medium-high speed to beat together one egg yolk, 8 ounces cream cheese, 3 tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 0.25 teaspoon vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth. Take the 2 sheets of puff pastry sheet and cut each into 4 squares. Fold the corners of each square over by about 1 inch to create octagon shapes.<br><br>
                    Evenly spoon the cream cheese mixture into the center of each pastry square, using about 2 tablespoons per square. Avoid spreading the cream cheese. Brush all exposed pastry with the egg wash, then generously dust with sugar.<br><br>
                    Bake the pastries until they are puffed and golden brown, which should take about 18 minutes. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.
