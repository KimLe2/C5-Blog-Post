                  Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare 2 baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper. <br><br>
                  In a small bowl, mix one whole egg with 1 teaspoon of water, then set aside. <br><br>
                  In a separate medium bowl, use an electric mixer on medium-high speed to beat together the egg yolk, cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla until the mixture is smooth. <br><br>
                  Take the 2 sheets of puff pastry and cut each into 4 squares. Fold the corners of each square over by about 1 inch to create octagon shapes.  <br><br>
                  Evenly spoon the cream cheese mixture into the center of each pastry square, using about 2 tablespoons per square. Avoid spreading the cream cheese. Brush all exposed pastry with the egg wash, then generously dust with sugar. <br><br>
                  Bake the pastries until they are puffed and golden brown, which should take about 18 minutes. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.
