                    1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare 2 baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper. <br><br>
                    2. In a small bowl, mix one whole egg with 1 teaspoon of water, then set aside.<br><br>
                    3. In a separate medium bowl, use an electric mixer on medium-high speed to beat together one egg yolk, 8 ounces cream cheese, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 0.25 teaspoon vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth. <br><br>
                    4. Take the 2 sheets of puff pastry sheet and cut each into 4 squares. <br><br>
                    5. Fold the corners of each square over by about 1 inch to create octagon shapes.<br><br>
                    6. Evenly spoon the cream cheese mixture into the center of each pastry square, using about 2 tablespoons per square. Avoid spreading the cream cheese. <br><br>
                    7. Brush all exposed pastry with the egg wash, then generously dust with sugar.<br><br>
                    8. Bake the pastries until they are puffed and golden brown, which should take about 18 minutes. <br><br>
                    9. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.
